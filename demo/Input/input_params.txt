#   fh is a flag for employing Flory-Huggins instead of double-well
#   changing_chi ==2 uses the gaussian form & 1 == uses double-well LG expression

#   kappa is surface tension parameter for protein, default = 0.5
#   chi is value of pairwise interaction
#   a,b,c are values of landau-ginzburg like three-way interaction & four way interactions
#   mu_r chooses whether you use D-R (mu_r=0) or chemical potential fo RNA (mu_r=1)
